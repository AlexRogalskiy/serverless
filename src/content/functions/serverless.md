Cloud functions are at the heart of building things in a serverless fashion. Serverless Framework is for helping build those. While it isn't an infrastructure _provider_ itself, it helps you deploy to any of the major providers, which is mighty helpful. It also has a method for running the functions locally, which is very useful for development and testing.
