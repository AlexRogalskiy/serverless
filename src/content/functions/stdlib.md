StdLib is based on Function as a Service ("server-less") architecture, popularized by AWS Lambda. You can use StdLib to build modular, scalable APIs for yourself and other developers in minutes without having to manage servers, gateways, domains, write documentation, or build SDKs. They also offer <a href="https://code.xyz/">Code.xyz</a>, and online code editor for working with the APIs.
