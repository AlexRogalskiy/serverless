Netlify lets you deploy Lambda functions without an AWS account, and with function management handled directly within Netlify. Your functions are version-controlled, built, and deployed along with the rest of your Netlify site, and we will automatically handle service discovery through our built-in API gateway. This eliminates overhead and brings the power of Deploy Previews and rollbacks to your functions.
