Guy Podjarny and Liran Tal from Snyk examine the significant benefits that serverless brings to application security, as well as the considerable risks involved when you configure a serverless system. You’ll also learn a platform-agnostic security model known as CLAD that will help you address Code vulnerabilities, Library vulnerabilities, Access and permissions, and Data security.</p>","fields":{"collection":"resources","slug":"serverless-security"}}}}]}}}
